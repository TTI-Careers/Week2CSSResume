# Week 2 CSS Resume Class Exercise

Try to add some CSS to this stylesheet!

- Move inline styling to separate stylesheet
- Change the background from white to another color (you may want to change the font color too if the colors clash!)
- Change all the headers from black to another color, make them all the same color
- Add a border to entire resume
- Bonus: Add a drop shadow behind resume
- Bonus: Add italics to main header (hint: first header on page)
